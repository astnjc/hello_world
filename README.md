Personal updates will be stored here.

My name is Austin JC. I recently decided to stop attending college. The college environment just didn't suite my learning style and needs. I'm now studying web development through self taught platforms. My plan is to acquire enough knowledge and skills before applying to a bootcamp. Soon after, or alongside, I'm also highly interested in Python.
