Learning and ideas will be stored here.

My name is Austin JC. I'm currently studying Psychology at Pennsylvania State University through their World Campus while learning Python at the moment through SoloLearn and edX with Microsoft Teach. I would prefer to learn programming skills instead of being in college, but I am undecided if I want to discontinue college yet. Time will tell. I'm a 26 year old adult learner at moment. I wish I would've gotten into programming sooner!
