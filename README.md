Learning and ideas will be stored here.

My name is Austin JC. I am currently studying Psychology at Pennsylvania State University through their World Campus while learning Python at the moment through SoloLearn and edX with Microsoft Teach. I would prefer to learn programming skills instead of being in college, but I am undecided if I want to discontinue college yet. Time will tell. I wish I would've gotten into programming sooner!
